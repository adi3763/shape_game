<h2>The Shape Game is an interactive Java-based application designed to calculate and display key geometric properties of various shapes. It enables users to input dimensions and instantly get results for:</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Area: The surface measurement of the shape.</li> 
<li>Perimeter: The total boundary length of the shape.</li>
<li>Lateral Surface Area (for 3D shapes): The area of the sides excluding bases.</li>
<li>Total Surface Area (for 3D shapes): The complete surface area, including all faces.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project demonstrates core Java concepts, including object-oriented programming, inheritance (for shape hierarchies),  for educational and analytical purposes.</p>
