The Shape Game is an interactive Java-based application designed to calculate and display key geometric properties of various shapes. It enables users to input dimensions and instantly get results for:

Area: The surface measurement of the shape.
Perimeter: The total boundary length of the shape.
Lateral Surface Area (for 3D shapes): The area of the sides excluding bases.
Total Surface Area (for 3D shapes): The complete surface area, including all faces.
This project demonstrates core Java concepts, including object-oriented programming, inheritance (for shape hierarchies),  for educational and analytical purposes.
